## Intro
Code for subscription for Final Project of Udacity AI Programming with Python Nanodegree.

This is a Python Command Line Application that can do two things:
1. Create a model based on the architecture of an efficient deep neural network, adapt it for the specfic problem, train the network, and save the model to a directory.
2. Use the trained model from number part 1. to classify an image.

## Dependencies

Python 3, PyTorch 0.4, 


Test accuracy: 79.5% for epochs = 4
